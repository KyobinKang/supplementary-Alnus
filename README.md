# Folders

## Bioactive_Molecular_Network

This folder contatins Jupyter notebook and data files for bioactive molecular networking, which was originally described in [Nothias et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00737)

## CSCS

This folder contatins Jupyter notebook and data files for calculating CSCS (Cemical structural and compositional similarity) metric and visualizing it via PCoA plot. The method and script was originally described in [Brejnrod et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1101/546150)

## PCA

This folder contatins Jupyter notebook and data files for principal component analysis.

# pyMolNetEnhancer

This folder contatins Jupyter notebook and data files for retreving class annotation for molecular familes using GNPS molecular networking, network annotation propagation (NAP) and Classyfire. More detailed description can be found at [Ernst et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo9070144)
-> Class annotation can be retreived using GNPS-embed MolNetEnhancer workflow which is described in the manuscript.

## rMolNetEnhancer

This folder contatins Jupyter notebook and data files for integration of molecular networking and MS2LDA. More detailed description can be found at [Ernst et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo9070144)
